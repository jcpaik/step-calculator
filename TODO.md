- Currently only supports binary operators. That is, (1+2)+3 or 1+(2+3), not 1+2+3. 
- Stringification of expression has too many brackets. 
- The current logic for delegating evaluation to subexpressions of an operator is a bit overloaded
  - General method for iterating/modifying subexpressions of an operator is needed
  - Use reflection?
- When evaluating subexpression, the surrounding expression disappears
  - e.g. when (1+2)+3 evaluates to 3+3, only 1+2 -> 3 shows
  - Use Lens
- The `for` loop looks very dirty as of now
  - Need to use `substeps` and `for` together and have two nested loops, which is essentially one
- There should be two levels of faliure
  - A failure where a different method can work
  - A `Fatal` failure like division by zero, where we should abort the calculation immediately
- Support negation
- Support multiplication by zero
  - One caveat is that expressions like `0 * (3 / (1-1))` cannot be evaluated
  - Add a silent solution that only checks for `Fatal` failure
